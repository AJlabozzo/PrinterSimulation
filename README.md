# PrinterSimulation
This was a project for Data Structures written in python that involved Queue's and simulated the effect of a queue would have on the time it would take for multiple printers to process jobs.

Note. Assignment5.py requires a .txt file to run with configurations for the printer simulation written in the following format :

line 1: duration of simulation integer seconds, int between 3600 and 36000   
line 2: number of Simulations, integer between 1 and 100  
line 3: minimum tast size, integer between 1 and 100  
line 4: maximum task size, integer between 1 and 100  
line 5: number of printers, integer value of 1 or 2  
line 6: page per minute for printer 1, integer value between 1 and 50  
line 7: page per minute for printer 2 if number of printers = 2, integer value between 1 and 50  

once the program executes it will create an output .txt file with results of the simulation.
